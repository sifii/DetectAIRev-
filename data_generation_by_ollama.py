            Examples:
            Review 1:
            "I liked the color, the silhouette, and the fabric of this dress. But the ruching just looked bunchy and ruined the whole thing. I was so disappointed, I really waned to like this dress. Runs a little small; I would need to size up to make it workappropriate."
            Review 2:
            "I was a little bit afraid about the size of this dress but I just received it and I'm in love! The size fits perfectly! The only thing is: I'm 5'2 so I find a bit long, but this is not a real problem! Thank you, ModCloth, now, I'm not afraid anymore about order more pieces of clothe!"
            Review 3:
            "I like this dress, but OMG is it short. I had to move it to the weekend clothes section of my closet, so I don't flash my coworkers. Maybe it works better for ladies with a little less booty, but if you have a round derriere, this is NSFW."
            Review 4:
            "I'm not familiar with dresses nor am I familiar with dresses over $25, but I saw this dress on polyvore and I knew I had to get it. Although the price had me waver, I'm incredibly satisfied with the product."
            Review 5:
            "The dress itself was great quality. I had to return it though.  Something was off in the chest area. I could quite figure it out, but it just didn't flatter me. It made me feel frumpy."
